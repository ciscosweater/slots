# Builds mGBA's libretro core from libretro/mgba at a pinned commit, with every patch beside
# this script applied, for whatever machine runs it. taskfile.yml's core:mgba:host runs it on
# the Mac; core:device runs it inside the H700 toolchain (or natively on aarch64 CI), so the
# .so links against the same sysroot as slot. Both use the flags libretro's own CI builds the
# buildbot core with, the SP's with link-time optimisation on top (device_cflags below), and the
# source is a checkout of the commit rather than a tarball, so git vouches for what was built.
#
#   build.sh stamp COMMIT               print what a build of COMMIT would record
#   build.sh build COMMIT WORKDIR OUT   build into WORKDIR, then write OUT and OUT.meta
#
# The .meta file is how the taskfile tells a stale core from a current one: it is compared
# against `stamp`, so a changed pin, patch or flag rebuilds, and a core fetched from the buildbot
# (which has no .meta) can never pass for this one.
#
# The core reports the version mGBA's build works out from the checkout, which is shallow and
# patched: 0.11-1-<commit>-dirty. The build re-derives it from git at compile time and takes no
# override, and "-dirty" is accurate. Nothing in slot reads it.

# Link-time optimisation, for the SP's core only: Linux aarch64, whether native or via the
# H700 cross toolchain (CROSS_COMPILE / CMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE). The Mac's core keeps exactly the
# flags above. Measured on the SP it takes 3 to 5% off every frame, on both games and at both
# step counts. -mcpu=cortex-a53 beside it gave most of that back and is deliberately absent.
# Nothing that can change a computed value goes here (no -ffast-math): link mode needs two SPs'
# machines to stay bit identical, and this changes how the core is compiled rather than what it
# computes — the frame hashes are unmoved. `stamp` prints it on every host, because the
# taskfile checks the SP's .meta from the Mac.
