//! The Game Boy palette against the real core: a monochrome cart run through slot's own
//! `open_core_for`, and the pixels it drew compared against the same cart with the palette
//! options left off.
//!
//! `apply_core_options` sets `mgba_gb_colors_preset` and `mgba_gb_colors` to reproduce what a
//! Game Boy Advance SP put on screen when an original Game Boy cartridge was pushed into it: the
//! Game Boy Color boot ROM the AGB inherits colourises a monochrome cart from a table keyed on
//! its header, and a cart with no entry in that table — which is every third-party and homebrew
//! cart, both of the monochrome ones on this machine's card among them — is given one specific
//! palette rather than a grey ramp. That comment says why those values; this says whether they
//! reach the screen.
//!
//! Nothing a draw list or an option read back out of the frontend's own map can answer: the core
//! would take `GBC Dark Green -A` as quietly as `GBC Dark Green →A` and simply never colour
//! anything, and mGBA's own default is grayscale, so a typo looks exactly like the option not
//! being set at all. So this runs the machine and looks at what came out.
//!
//! `SCRATCH_PNG_DIR=/tmp cargo test -p slot --test render_gb_palette -- --nocapture`
//!
//! Skipped on a machine with no mGBA dylib and no card to take a cart off, the same way every
//! other test here that needs a real core is.
