//! The quick menu's Colour Correction against the real core: the same cart, the same number of
//! emulated frames, once with the row off and once with it on, and the two pictures compared.
//!
//! The one question a row like this has to answer is whether anyone can see it. A draw list
//! cannot answer that and neither can an option read back out of the frontend's own map — the
//! core would accept `Autp` just as quietly as `Auto` and simply never tint anything. So this
//! runs the machine and looks at the pixels it drew.
//!
//! Deliberately deterministic: both runs load the same ROM, press nothing, and run exactly the
//! same number of frames, so every pixel that differs between them differs because of the
//! option and not because one run got further into an animation than the other. That is what
//! lets the difference be measured rather than merely eyeballed.
//!
//! `SCRATCH_PNG_DIR=/tmp cargo test -p slot --test render_colour_correction -- --nocapture`
//!
//! Skipped on a machine with no mGBA dylib and no card to take a cart off, the same way every
//! other test here that needs a real core is.
