/// The device panel's frame, and the twin of `device_app`'s `FRAME`. That loop has always
/// timed its own frame on the grounds that "a driver that ignores the swap interval would
/// spin this loop as fast as the GPU can clear"; this loop never did, because the swap here
/// is asked for vsync (`slot_gfx::host`) and vsync was assumed to do the waiting.
///
/// It does, right up until macOS decides nobody can see the window. An occluded NSOpenGL
/// surface is not presented at all, so `CGLFlushDrawable` has no vblank to wait for and
/// returns immediately — measured at 0.22 ms against 7.9 ms visible. With `ControlFlow::Poll`
/// below and a redraw requested unconditionally after every swap, that leaves nothing at all
/// pacing the loop, and it free-runs: 1900 frames a second, a whole core, for a window that is
/// behind something else. Putting Activity Monitor in front of slot to read its CPU is enough
/// to cause it, which is how it came to be reported.
///
/// So the host gets the guard the device already had, for the reason the device already had
/// it.
///
/// On a panel faster than 60 Hz this is a cap and not only a floor: a 120 Hz Mac was drawing
/// the shelf 120 times a second and now draws it 60. That is the rate the device being
/// simulated runs at, every animation here is already driven by `dt` rather than by a frame
/// count, and the emulator worker was never paced from this loop at all — it keeps its own
/// `PRESENT` deadline (see `emu`), so a game's audio and its rate control do not notice. Half
/// the presents for the same picture is the point rather than a cost.
