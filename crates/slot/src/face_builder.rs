//! The open cart's faces, built off the render thread. On the H700 a board takes the better part
//! of half a second to rasterise, which on the frame loop is half a second of frozen shelf, so
//! the frontend asks for the highlighted cart's faces as the caret lands and uploads them when
//! they come back. Only the newest request matters: a caret that has moved on has no use for the
//! cart it passed.
