//! Whether a picture is drawn at its own size or stretched over the whole panel, and which of
//! the two each cart was last left in.
//!
//! The Game Boy and the Game Boy Color had no shoulder buttons, so on one of their carts slot
//! takes L and R: L stretches the picture to fill the panel, R gives back the largest whole
//! multiple of it, centred. On a GBA cart the two are the GBA's own and this file has nothing
//! to say — a GBA picture already fills the panel at exactly 3x, and there is no second size
//! for it to have.
//!
//! The stretch distorts, deliberately. 160x144 is 10:9 against a 3:2 panel, so a fullscreen
//! Game Boy picture comes out about 35% wider than it is tall. That is what a Game Boy picture
//! blown up to fill a television looked like, and it is the mode the user asked for by name.
//! The aspect-correct alternative — 533x480 with 93 px bars either side — is neither fullscreen
//! nor period-correct, and it would cost the panel-locked grille as well (see `GAME_FRAG`), so
//! it is not offered.
